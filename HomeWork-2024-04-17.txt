1. DOM manipulation. Continue with DOM1.html.
   a) In HTML create turquoise div and red div that will be ajacent 
      to the right side of the turquoise DIV. 

   b) Create function showFavouriteFood() - it adds the text 
      "My favourite food is " to the turquoiseDiv, and the text "pizza"
      to the redDiv. Add event listener for 'mouseover' event for the
      turquoiseDiv that will run this function. Add event listener like this
      to the redDiv too.

   c) Create function toggleWidth() that will toggle between the width of 
       300px and 200px for redDiv. Add event listener to the yellowBtn
       that on "click" will run this function (it is a new listener!)

   d) Invent some change of one of the buttons while hovering over them
       ('mouseover' event, and may be 'mouseout' too). Create appropriate 
       callback function and event listener.
